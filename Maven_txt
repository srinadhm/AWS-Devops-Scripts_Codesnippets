-----------------
what is build tool
different build tools (maven,gradle,ant)
how many ways to create java project
spring.io
ide 
command line 
how to build spring boot or java project ----- mvn clean install or mvn clean package
maven different life cycle phases
mvn clean --- download all dependencies and clean the project
mvn install --- build the project and generate jar/war file based on the packaging tag in pom.xml by generating new folder target (all the spring boot projects by default extension is jar)

jar name ---- demo-project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

<artifact name>-<snapshot version>.<packaging>

<artifactId>demo-project</artifactId>-<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>.jar

we can define our own jar file name by adding <finalName> tag under buildtag 

spring boot project default packaging will be jar we can change it to war 

how to run a jar file

java -jar <jar file name>

for every spring boot application it has default embedded severs like tomcat we can configure jetty as well
tomcat runs on 8080 
if 8080 already runs on another tomcat server or jenkins we have to change port number  under main/resources/application.properties with server.port=9999

how to run project in different envs like dev qa/tesing staging/uat and prod
application.properties
application-dev.properties
application-qa.properties
application-uat.properties
application-prod.prop

java -jar <jarfilename> -Dspring.profiles.active=dev/qa/uat/prod

 
1.clone the repo from git
2.build the project using maven
3.run the jar/war file

we need to do above tasks using jenkins ( by integrating git and maven plugins or setting git,java path)

In jenkins 

types of jenkins job 
1.free style ( we can develop any projects , master slave configuration wont applicable)
2.pipeline( declarative and scipted )
3.maven project ( we need to add maven plugin to create a maven project)

declarative pipeline 
pipeline{
}
in order to run the pipeline we need an agent, if we dont have slave agents or slave labels only jenkins master is present
we can mention agent as any 
and each pipeline had lot of stages 
each stage had lot of steps
--------------
if we want to run jenkins job if someone commits or change something in github
what if we want to run the job on slave machine

for scripted pipeline it starts with node
we should not directly run java -jar jarfile name 
before that we need to check our code is good quality or bad quality
as some one  commits the code we need to run this analysis
for this we need to integate with sonarqube
if the code quality is good we need those artifacts in jfrog or nexus or amazons3
if the code quality is bad we need to fail the build
how to integrate maven project with sonarqube
how to deploy maven project to nexus
we need to integrate nexus and sonarqube to jenkins

regardless of job pass or fail we need to send email notification to job owner or stakeholders

we cannot run nexus as root user change the permissions for ec2-user 

1.get the code from github
2.build the code
3.analyse the code
4.get the results of code analysis
5.if success upload the artifacts to nexus/jfrog
6.based on result decide to pass or fail and send email notification if failure 

-------------------------------

if we want to do code quality analysis of any maven project we need to integrate with sonar qube
in order to integrate with sonarqube we need to know about sonar token 
without sonar token we cant do analysis
we can integrate gradle with sonarqube
python with sonarqube
nodejs with sonarqube
sonarqube 7 --- > java 8
sonarqube 8 --- > java 11
needs 2 vcpus and required instance t2.medium
checkout   build the project   run the sonarqube for analysis quallity gate deploy to nexus
git ---- maven ---- sonarqube ---- nexus 

after sonarqube integration is done we need to install nexus and deploy java project using maven to nexus

mvn deploy --- we need to mention nexus url under distribution management

we need to mention nexus repository location, snapshot repository url and release repository url 
in pom.xml version is snapshot it will go to nexus snapshot repository
without snapshot it will go to nexus snapshot repository

we need to mention nexus username,password,id element in /opt/apache-maven-3.8.1/conf.settings.xml

nexus port number ---- 8081
sonarqube port number ---- 9000
tomcat/jenkins port number ---- 8080

maven sonarqube plugin ---- https://www.baeldung.com/sonar-qube
spring boot slf4j logging ---- https://mkyong.com/spring-boot/spring-boot-slf4j-logging-example/
Install nexus3 on centos/redhat/amazon linux https://devopscube.com/how-to-install-latest-sonatype-nexus-3-on-linux/
Install java11 on Amazon linux2 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/amazon-linux-install.html
Deploy maven project to nexus https://www.baeldung.com/maven-deploy-nexus
http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.8.1/maven-core/lifecycles.html


quality profile vs quality gates in sonarqube 
we can attach quality gates to quality profile
mvn clean install
mvn clean package
mvn dependency:tree
mvn deploy 
mvn life cycle phases

ci --- with and without docker
cd --- with and without docker and kubernetes
anisble

we need to do ci for java project
continuous integration
1.get the code from github
2.build the code 
3.we need to run the final artifacts jar/war

----------------------

how to trigger jenkins job if someone commits code or raise pull request in git.

Project 1
=========
Please Develop a role in Ansible to create 2 tier Architecture with AWS Load Balancer & Amazon Linux (1 web & 1 App(tomcat)) machines with health strings to setup Web & App layers with sample applications with Reverse Proxy.

The Role should accept arguments with number of EC2 machines to be created and JDK version to be installed. 
Write separate playbooks for LB, Web, App, Proxy & JDK installation with variables.

========
Project 2:
========
Please Create Job in Jenkins to develop an application and deploy in Docker Swarm.
a) Use separate Maven Image to Build.
b) Use docker hub to store the Images.
c) Use docker stack to deploy the images into Docker Swarm.
